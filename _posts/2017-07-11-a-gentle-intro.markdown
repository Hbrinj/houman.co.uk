You've decided in the midsts of all the things not currently going on (I'll be graduating in 7 days) that, you'll start your career by making your second, first mark on the world (wide web). This post and the rest of the blog will cover how I got to whatever this will eventually look like and some extra bits.

First, lets get through some formalities. I'm starting this blog to document my progress and understanding. I'll try to keep the waffle relatively low but, the blogs' secondary use is to improve my communication skills (at some point I'm sure it will magically get better). I'm going to be a Computer Science MSci graduate from the University of nottingham in 7 days, having spent a little too long in education. I've worked on a few things already, each of which has taught me I simply don't know enough.
