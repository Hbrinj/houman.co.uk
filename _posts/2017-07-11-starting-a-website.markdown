# Preamble
I'll explore some of the static website generators I looked at before I picked Jekyll. However, I feel like I've cheated you, the reader, out of a good story, needless to say, if you're a glass half full kind of person you'll enjoy the adventure, I'm sure.

# Why
Static site generators (SSG) allow you, the time savvy, post modern individual, to generate the boiler plate code using some, not so boiler plate code written by someone else. In essence, it saves you from doing the grunt work, letting you do the important stuff.

To save you time, they typically have support for templates, themes and blogs. The generators will take a file written in some high level language, say markdown, convert it and place it within the template code. No longer are you working with the raw html. This way of doing things makes SSGs both powerful and flexible.

# Criteria
The criteria was simple. Which ever It'd have to be well supported with a large community, opensource and easy to install. Much later did I decide that a blogging mechanism would be handy.
